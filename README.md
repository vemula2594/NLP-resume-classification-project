# NLP-resume-classification-project  :
The NLP Resume Classification project involves building a text classification model to predict the job profile category for a given resume. The goal is to help HR professionals automate the process of resume screening and candidate selection. The project uses various machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques for preprocessing the text data and evaluating the performance of the model.

Business Objective:

The objective of this project is to classify resumes into different categories based on the job profile. The project involves a text classification problem where the goal is to predict the job profile category for a given resume. The dataset contains resumes for various job profiles and their respective categories. The project aims to help HR professionals automate the process of resume screening and candidate selection.

Dataset: The dataset contains resumes for various job profiles and their respective categories. The dataset includes the following variables:

Resume Text: The text data of the resumes.
Category: The job profile category for the given resume.

Approach: The project involves building a text classification model to predict the job profile category for a given resume. Various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest can be used for this purpose. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization can be used to preprocess the text data. The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: Classifying resumes into different job profile categories can help HR professionals automate the process of resume screening and candidate selection. By using the given text data, a classification model can be built to predict the job profile category for a given resume. The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, and the best model can be selected for deployment.
