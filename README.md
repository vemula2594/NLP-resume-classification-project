# NLP-resume-classification-project

The business objective of an NLP resume classification project could be to automate the process of screening and sorting job applications by analyzing the content of resumes. This would help save time and resources for the HR department, allowing them to focus on the most promising candidates and potentially reducing bias in the hiring process.

Specifically, the project could involve developing a model that can read and analyze the text of resumes, extract relevant information (e.g. work experience, education, skills), and classify them into different categories. The model could be trained on a dataset of labeled resumes, and evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the correct category for new, unseen resumes.

Overall, the goal of the project would be to create a tool that can help streamline the recruitment process, make it more efficient, and potentially reduce human error and bias.
